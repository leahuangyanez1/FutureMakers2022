# FutureMakers2022

7 / 6 day 1: got more familiar with python and some addons like numpy and pandas. excited for the rest of the program and prospect of finally being able to create my own ai programs.

7/7 day 2: i am learning many new terms related to machine learning. i also learned a little more about how discrimination can happen in ai, which was really interesting.
