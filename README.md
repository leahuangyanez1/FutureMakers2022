7/15 day 4-6: i can understand how layers work better now, like what different types of layers do (activation, input, output) and what choices there are within that and how they change the outcome depending on what function it is. yesterday we learned about convolution layers, so i learned about filters and how dl uses that to extract targetted information from an image to find patterns within them. 

7/10 day 3: things are moving quite fast! i followed instructions to make my own deep learning models, and practiced with different types like linear regression. as i do hands on practice, deep learning is making a lot more sense to me than it did before hand, so im looking forward to continue learning

7/7 day 2: i am learning many new terms related to machine learning. i also learned a little more about how discrimination can happen in ai, which was really interesting.

7 / 6 day 1: got more familiar with python and some addons like numpy and pandas. excited for the rest of the program and prospect of finally being able to create my own ai programs.
