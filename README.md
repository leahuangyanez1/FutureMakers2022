7/10 day 3: things are moving quite fast! i followed instructions to make my own deep learning models, and practiced with different types like linear regression. as i do hands on practice, deep learning is making a lot more sense to me than it did before hand, so im looking forward to continue learning

7/7 day 2: i am learning many new terms related to machine learning. i also learned a little more about how discrimination can happen in ai, which was really interesting.

7 / 6 day 1: got more familiar with python and some addons like numpy and pandas. excited for the rest of the program and prospect of finally being able to create my own ai programs.
